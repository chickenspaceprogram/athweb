# Athena Boose

I'm a Computer Science student primarily interested in systems programming,
compilers, and programming language design. This site is partly a landing page,
but it also has some blog posts and other stuff.

To contact me, check out the [about](about.html) page.

This site is written in a combination of HTML, CSS, and Markdown, and the
files get run through the macro preprocessor m4. It's nothing fancy but it
gets the job done.
