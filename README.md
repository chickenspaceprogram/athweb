My personal website.

To build this, you'll need my
[hmacro](https://github.com/chickenspaceprogram/hmacro) utility installed
somewhere on your path, as well as Pandoc.

I would've used Unix's m4, but it doesn't mix well with plaintext.
(The C preprocessor doesn't mix well with Markdown, otherwise I'd have used it.)
hmacro kinda sucks, frankly, but it is just functional enough for this to work.
